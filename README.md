Iâ€™m a user experience and interface designer (UX/UI), currently designing at CVS Health.

I recently designed web experiences at LogMeIn. Before that, I learned from the best in the industry as a designer at Cantina. I also wrote my fair share of code as a web developer for Cambridge Systematics.
